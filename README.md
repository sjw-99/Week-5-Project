# Introduction

Here is a brief overview of the problem statement for the project, and an insight into how Mission Academy came to be.

## Problem Statement

The management team of the Hive group of secondary schools noticed a lack of engagement in non-STEM subjects over the last two years. They want to reverse this trend and asked us to come up with a solution that places student enjoyment at the heart of the learning experience.

## Our User-Led Vision

We wanted to create a game that placed educational value **and** enjoyment at it's core. We therefore chose to design and begin production on an application that contains a wealth of multiple-choice quizzes (we call them missions) for different subjects and topics to support students' learning.

Speaking to our stakeholders, the key criteria we identified were:

- Short, snappy, curriculum targeted questions that test key knowledge.
- Instant feedback on a question-by-question basis, as well as an opportunity for more detailed reflection and revision opportunity.
- A fun and engaging user experience.

We are excited to share with you the first phase of our development, mission one, a World War One themed quiz!

# Getting Started

To begin your journey with Mission Academy, first install our app from our GitHub repository:

1. Navigate to the place in your directory you would like to install Mission Academy to.
2. From your terminal, run `git clone git@github.com:sjw-99/Week-5-Project.git`.

Then you will need to install the necessary packages to run our app. To do this, run the following command in your terminal: `npm i`

You are now ready to get started with your first mission! To launch the game, run the following command in your terminal: `npm run start`

Our application requires you to register an account so that we can track your progress and assign you to your teaching classes. On first opening Mission Academy, you will need to follow the steps on screen to create your account as shown below:

![Mission Academy Account Registration Page](/README_assets/Register.png)

For all future logins, hit the 'login' button at the bottom of the registration page. That will take you to our login page:

![Mission Academy Login Page](/README_assets/Login.png)

Once you've logged in, you will be greeted by our homepage and be able to begin your first mission!

# User Guide

Here you will find a walkthrough of the Mission Academy application, from homepage to quiz completion. Our user guide assumes you have registered an account with us and logged in as per our getting started instructions.

## The Homepage

The first place you will land is our homepage where you can select a mission, track your top missions, progress, and compare your knowledge to other members of your class! Here is an example of what your homepage might look like:

![Example of the Mission Academy Homepage](/README_assets/Homepage.jpg)

From here, clicking the 'Start the Mission' button will allow you to select a mission.

## Mission Selection

Here you will find all of the missions available to you:

Whether it's last minute homework for your WW1 topic or you simply want to swat up on your Roman history, here is your portal to dive back in time and see what you know!

For this example let's suppose you select the 'World War 1 Mission', but you could always go back to your homepage to see where you need to improve by clicking 'view progress'.

## Mission Questions

Once your time machine is parked safely, you will be greeted by your first question. All our questions follow the same easy-to-understand format:

- An intro, setting the scene and helping you recall your history lesson.
- The question - short, snappy, and to the point. Do you know what you need to know?
- A picture - another helpful prompt to get those neurones firing.
- Your options to choose from.

![Example of Quiz Question](/README_assets/Question.jpg)

All missions consist of ten questions, providing the perfect quick-fire revision opportunity! After you answer each question, you will immediately see if you answer was correct (green), or incorrect (red).

## Summary Page

With all of your questions answered, now's your chance to see how you got on and sharpen up on your knowledge gaps. Our application takes your responses and automatically marks your work, giving you a score out of ten and a question-by-question breakdown. You will be able to see:

- Each individual question.
- Your answer, and if it was correct or incorrect answer.
- The correct answer, if yours wasn't.

![Example of Summary Page](/README_assets/Summary.jpg)

This is your opportunity to do some quick revision, so that you're ready to ace your next mission or class test!

## What's Next for Mission Academy?

Here is a brief overview of a few of the exciting features we are aiming to implement soon!

### More Missions!

Now that our initial prototype is up and running, we are looking forward to adding more missions so you can hop back to any time, any time.

### More Subjects!

Mission Academy has a broader ambition to bring our formula beyond just your history lessons, we think (and hope you agree) that there is space for all of your humanities and MFL subjects at the academy.

### Daily Streak & Character Levelling

You, the student, are the core of Mission Academy's goals. That's why we want to give you all the tools and fun features you need to keep coming back to Mission Academy as your learning progresses. A daily streak is a nice way to keep track of your hard work, and your own historian to level up and customise will make your account unique!
